I was finally able to record and post the lecture from the <a href="//www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyQr4689RR7DIKTWX12cVIfnu9erVRkHE" target="blank_">missed class on 10-30-2014</a>.  It covers isoparametric elements and Gauss integration, and has an associated quiz on available on <a href="//utexas.instructure.com/courses/1119539/quizzes/1051906" target="blank_">Canvas</a>.  Additionally, I recorded a short example video showing how to solve a simple problem on a 2D domain is is available <a href="//www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyQr4689RR7CevkvG80L8PEcBfG31RTge" target="blank_">here</a>, as well as on the [Course Materials](/course-mat/) page.  I highly recommend watching this example before attempting <a href="/files/assignment5.pdf" target="blank_">Homework Assignment 5</a> which is now available and due on **11-25-2014**.
