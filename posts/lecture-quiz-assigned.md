As I've mentioned in class, there will be no scheduled class period on Thursday, 
September 4.  I've already recorded and posted a lecture for that day on the [Course Materials](/course-mat/)
page.  Registered students with <a href="//utexas.instructure.com/courses/1119539/" target="blank_">Canvas</a> access will now
notice that an <a href="//utexas.instructure.com/courses/1119539/quizzes/1038905/" target="blank_">assignment</a> has been posted.  
The assignment is to watch the video lecture and take a very short quiz before class on 09/09/2014.  The quiz
is extremely simple and the material is explicitly from the lecture.  It is only intended to enforce that you
watch the lecture.  

There will be several of these quizzes throughout the semester.  The total percentage of correct
answers for all quiz grades will count as 1 homework assignment in the overall grading structure.
