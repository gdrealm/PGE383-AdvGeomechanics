A recorded lecture has been posted covering the material intended for Tuesday, 9/30/2014.  Please watch the recording and take the [Quiz](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1119539/quizzes/1042906) before class on 10/7/2014.  I did not have time to record this Thursday's (10/2/2014) lecture before I left on travel so I will make up this lecture at a later date.  

Class will be held as scheduled on 10/7/2014 and this is a reminder that your [Homework Assignment #2](http://johntfoster.github.io/PGE383-AdvGeomechanics/files/assignment2.pdf) is due at the beginning of class.
